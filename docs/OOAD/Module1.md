# Object Oriented Analysis and Design 

## Modules 1 (Pre-recorded)

### What is Object Oriented Programming paradigms

![image](../img/OOAD/Module%201%20Paradigms.png)

Program - instructions to perform certain tasks it's called as program. eg: addition of 2 numbers
Programming -  whenever programmer developed this programs that particular activity is called as programming
Software - collection of programs
Procedural - Gives lot of importance to procedure. ie., Logic + Procedure (data or output)
Modular programming - Put logic in different modules (helps in reuse)
Object oriented programming - Gives first important to data and then to logic

Insted of programming computer to do calculation (mathematical functions), OO programming attempst to model interacting components to build a solution

### SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

* Analyze - understand problem (Domain experts like BA)
* Design - solution - intended system (Aware of domain and create blueprint like Architect)
* Implement - system is getting constructed (Coder)
* Test - correctness, performance, usability (Tester)
* Deployment - deploy system  (Release management team)
* Maintenance - fixes & enhancements (Supports)

### Waterfall model

All the stages are done one after the other from top to bottom. This means that all requirements are gathered first then it is all analyzed and then the design has started. Now it is difficult to add another requirement from the customer till the acceptance phase.

* Requirement and analysis - Analysis
* Acceptance - Deployment and mainteance

It is also called Vendor centric model

Advantages
1.  Simple in approach

Disadvantages
1. Sequential in design no space for concurrency
2. Poor resource utilisation
3. Not friendly changes
