# Object Oriented Analysis and Design 

## Modules 1 (Pre-recorded)

### What is Object Oriented Programming paradigms

Program - instructions to perform certain tasks it's called as program. eg: addition of 2 numbers
Programming -  whenever programmer developed this programs that particular activity is called as programming
Software - collection of programs
Procedural - Gives lot of importance to procedure. ie., Logic + Procedure (data or output)
Modular programming - Put logic in different modules (helps in reuse)
Object oriented programming - Gives first important to data and then to logic

Insted of programming computer to do calculation (mathematical functions), OO programming attempst to model interacting components to build a solution

### SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)

* Analyze - understand problem (Domain experts like BA)
* Design - solution - intended system (Aware of domain and create blueprint like Architect)
* Implement - system is getting constructed (Coder)
* Test - correctness, performance, usability (Tester)
* Deployment - deploy system  (Release management team)
* Maintenance - fixes & enhancements (Supports)

### Waterfall model

* Requirement and analysis - Analysis
* Acceptance - Deployment and mainteance

It is also called Vendor centric model

Advantages
