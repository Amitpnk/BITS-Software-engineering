## Modules

### What is Software Architecture

Software architecture is the blueprint of building software. Blueprint of a software system that helps stakeholders to understand how the system would be once it is implemented 

Description in details,
A description at a higher level of abstraction than objects and lines of codes 
So that Stakeholders understand and reason about without getting lost into a sea of details


### Who is Stakeholders

Software architecture is not necessary to say yes to all area of concern, but he should ready with answer for all to stakeholders must agree


### Why Architecture needs to be described

1. Each stakeholder has his own interpretation of the systems
Sometimes no understanding at all
Architect is the middleman who co-ordinates with these stakeholders
2. How will everyone be convinced that his expectations from the system will be satisfied?
3. Even when the architect has created the solution blueprint, how does she handover the solution to the developers?
4. How do the developers build and ensure critical aspects of the system?
5. Misunderstanding leads to incorrect implementation
Leads to 10 times more effort to fix at a later stage
